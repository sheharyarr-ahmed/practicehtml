        The iPhone 16 Pro is one of the most unfinished products Apple has ever
        shipped. Almost all of its highlight features will arrive in future
        software updates that will stretch well into next year before they’re
        here. That’s big stuff, like the new Apple Intelligence AI features the
        company says will start slowly arriving in October, and little stuff,
        like the complete functionality of the new Camera Control button on the
        side

        The new iPad Pro is a genuine achievement in tablet design. It’s the
        closest thing I’ve ever seen to the vision that a tablet should feel not
        like a computer but, rather, like a piece of glass in your hand. I’m
        honestly not sure how you’d shrink it more; the USB-C plug I use to
        charge the 13-inch Pro I’ve been testing is already thicker than the
        iPad itself. It’s a light, fast, remarkable machine.

        Goodbye, 13-inch MacBook Pro. I will not miss your cramped screen and
        Touch Bar. Hello, 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro, the new entry-level Pro on the
        block. In many ways, this MacBook is my “what could’ve been.” Earlier
        this year, fed up with waiting for a larger iMac, I threw up my hands
        and traded in my personal laptop, a 13-inch Intel-powered MacBook Pro,
        for the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. (Because, if you have the means, you
        should keep work and personal machines separate.) I briefly considered
        copping a 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro, but I was not keen to continue living
        that Touch Bar life and wanted a bigger display. The 14-inch had the M2
        Pro chip, which was more chip than I needed for more dollars than I
        wanted to spend. In that context, the 15-inch made the most sense for my
        home setup.
